## Overview

**BIM3D Hub** is a universal 3D interoperability platform designed to solve one of the biggest challenges in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC), and Industrial Design industries: the lack of an operational standard that allows the same 3D object to function with quality and fidelity across any software, eliminating rework and information loss.

## Key Features

- Intelligent `.b3do` format with complete geometry, PBR materials, and BIM metadata.
- Multi-platform converter supporting formats like FBX, SKP, and more.
- Plugins for SketchUp, Blender, Rhino, with upcoming support for Revit and ArchiCAD.
- Centralized cloud library of interoperable 3D models.
- Modern web interface for model viewing and management.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bim3dhub/bim3dhub.git
```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the web interface.
